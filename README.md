## 🧑‍💻 About me:

I'm a Software Engineer with over 9 years of hands-on experience in WEB
development across next domains: **e-Learning, e-Commerce /
Marketplaces, Trading, Insurance and Health Care**. I've contributed to
projects in various delivery models - from outstaffing to startups -
adapting quickly to diverse workflows, business goals, and team
dynamics.

I've worked both independently and in teams of 3 to 20 engineers, often
within international, distributed environments. **English has been the
primary language** for communication, technical discussions, and client
interaction, helping me align development work with business needs and
enhance cross-team collaboration.

I hold a **Master's Degree in Software Engineering**, which provided a
strong foundation in architecture design, secure coding, algorithms, and
systems thinking. I continue applying and expanding this knowledge
through challenging production engineering tasks.

As a **full-stack developer**, I deliver solutions from frontend
interfaces to backend services and infrastructure. On the frontend, I
use **React, Vue, and Angular**, and also develop cross-platform mobile
apps with **Flutter**. On the backend, I work with **Go, Python, and
Node.js** to build APIs, services, and background workers. I'm
experienced with **monolithic and microservice architectures**,
**REST/GraphQL APIs**, and databases like **MySQL and MongoDB**. I
actively use **Docker** and implement **CI/CD pipelines** for automated
deployment. Additionally, I use testing frameworks such as **Playwright
and Jest** to ensure high code quality and reliability.

My responsibilities include **project evaluation and planning, technical
estimations, architecture design, and MVP scoping**. I collaborate
closely with stakeholders to define requirements, select appropriate
technologies, and ensure maintainability. I also mentor junior
developers, conduct code reviews, and support onboarding. I follow
**Agile/SCRUM** methodologies to enable iterative delivery and maintain
high team velocity.

I'm committed to continuous learning and staying current with evolving
technologies. I regularly solve complex programming and system design
problems on **LeetCode** to sharpen my algorithmic thinking and
technical skills. Recently, I have obtained advanced certifications and
completed intensive bootcamps specializing in **Machine Learning and
Computer Vision**.

Also I actively integrate **AI-powered tools** - such as automated
code generation, intelligent testing frameworks, and performance
optimization utilities - into my development workflows to boost
productivity, reduce manual effort, and improve application scalability.
